# How to test user stories:

> Note that functionality is seen best if you log in as the example user so that you already belong to two groups, each of which contain three lists. Clicking Group 1's card on the Groups page and then List A on the Lists page will allow you to see the most example data in the item table on the Items page.

> To test the netlify deploy, simply follow the link in the changelog.

> To test the account page, simply register with an account or log in to an existing account and navigate to the Account page from the navigation panel that opens from the top left.

> To test the group chat, log in with the example user or create a new user. If creating a new user, you will need to create a group. Then, the group chat will be accessible from the message icon in the bottom right hand corner of the Groups page and the Lists page (which you can get to by clicking on a Group card on the Groups page).

> To test group creation, click the plus icon on the Groups page. To test group editing and deletion, click on the pen icon in the bottom right corner of a Group card. The pen icon only shows up for Groups that the logged in user has created themself. The example user is able to edit both currently existing Groups in the Back4App database.

> To test list creation, click the plus icon on the Lists page. To test list editing and deletion, click on the pen icon in the bottom right corner of a List card. The pen icon shows up for all lists in a group; it does not matter which user created a given list.

> To test item creation, navigate to the Items page by clicking on a List card. Then press the plus icon in the top right hand corner of the item table. To test item editing, click on an item in the table and then click on the pen icon in the top right hand corner of the item table. Or use one of the several toggle buttons in the top right of the item table after selecting one or more items. To test deleting an item, press the delete button for the specific icon at the right end of the item's row in the table. Note that you can view an item's photo by clicking on an item in the item table and then clicking the photo icon at the top right of the item table.

> To test the payment summary, simply click the payment summary button at the bottom of the Items page, underneath the item table. Its functionality is shown best if multiple users have marked items as purchased or desired.
